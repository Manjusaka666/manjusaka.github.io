# La vie en Chamonix

## It might be the simplest way to install Tensorflow or Tensorflow-GPU by conda install in the conda environment
Nowadays, there are many tutorials that instruct how to install tensorflow or tensorflow-gpu. However, some people may feel it too complex just like me, because in those ways, you should download and install NVIDIA drivers, and then download and install CUDA (users need to pay attention to the version), afterwards you may sign an agreement and download cuDNN in NVIDIA Developer. Next, install python, and pip install tensorflow-gpu and so on. It's not esay for developer to do these, let alone it might causes some other error such as version not match, or conflict between other python libraries and so on. Moreover, if you want to install tensorflow by compilation, it may take much more time.

Thus I strongly reconmend you not to do this, there's a much easier way to install this. Please read the following article.
